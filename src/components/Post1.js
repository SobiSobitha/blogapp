           <p>JavaScript is a programming language that brings web pages to life. It's the core technology of the web, working alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML structures the content and CSS styles it,
           JavaScript code is embedded within HTML files or linked to them as external scripts. When a web page is loaded, the browser's JavaScript engine interprets and executes the code.
